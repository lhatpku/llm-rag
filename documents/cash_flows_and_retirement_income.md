## 2. Retirement Income Sources

- **401(k), Traditional IRA**: Pre-tax, subject to RMDs and ordinary income tax
- **Roth IRA / Roth 401(k)**: Tax-free withdrawals (subject to 5-year and age 59½ rules)
- **Brokerage Accounts**: Taxable, but flexible
- **Pensions**: Defined benefit income
- **Annuities**: Guaranteed lifetime payments
- **Social Security**: Inflation-protected, partially taxable
- **Other**: Rental income, business cash flow, part-time work

## 3. Withdrawal Order Strategy

Optimal sequence minimizes taxes and improves portfolio longevity.

### General Rule of Thumb:

```text
1. Taxable (Brokerage)
2. Tax-Deferred (Traditional 401(k)/IRA)
3. Tax-Free (Roth IRA)
```

### Exceptions:
- Low tax bracket years → accelerate IRA withdrawals
- Delay SS + use 401(k) bridge withdrawals
- Coordinate with Medicare IRMAA brackets

---

## 4. Tax-Efficient Drawdown

### 4.1 Capital Gain Harvesting

Use 0% long-term capital gain bracket (for low-income years):
- Married filing jointly: $0 – $89,250 (2024)
- Realize gains in brokerage account without tax

### 4.2 Roth Conversions

Convert IRA → Roth during low tax years (before RMDs start at age 73):
- Fills lower tax brackets today
- Reduces future RMDs
- Can grow tax-free forever

---

## 5. Bridging to Social Security

- Delay SS to age 70 increases benefit by 24%–32%
- Fund gap years (62–70) via:
  - Brokerage account withdrawals
  - Roth conversions
  - Part-time work

**Cash Flow Planning Objective**:
Balance guaranteed income + withdrawal stability + tax smoothing.

## 6. Dynamic Withdrawal Methods

### 6.1 4% Rule (Bengen)

Withdraw 4% of initial portfolio value, adjust for inflation

### 6.2 Guyton-Klinger Rules

- Guardrails on withdrawal changes
- Raise/lower based on portfolio returns

### 6.3 Floor-and-Upside Model

- Secure basic expenses via SS + annuities
- Withdraw from portfolio for discretionary needs

---

## 7. Modeling Retirement Budget

Include:
- Essential vs discretionary expenses
- Health care, Medicare, long-term care
- Tax projection based on account type
- Required minimum distributions (RMDs)

---

## 8. Lifetime Income Strategies

### 8.1 Annuity Integration

- SPIAs: Lifetime income with no market risk
- Deferred Income Annuities (DIAs): Kick in at later age
- QLACs: Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract (excluded from RMDs)

### 8.2 Pension Options

- Single vs joint survivor
- Inflation-adjusted vs level
- Lump-sum buyout vs lifetime stream

## 9. Summary

Strategic coordination of cash flows — across accounts, tax brackets, and time — enables a more predictable, tax-optimized retirement. Flexibility and forward planning reduce sequence-of-return risk and support confident spending throughout retirement.
