# Social Security: Basics and Claiming Strategies

## 1. Overview

Social Security is a critical source of guaranteed lifetime income for retirees. Understanding how benefits are calculated and how claiming age affects the payout is vital to sound retirement planning. This guide covers the mechanics of benefit calculation, the impact of claiming decisions, and advanced strategies for maximizing household benefits.

## 2. How Social Security Works

- Funded via payroll taxes (FICA: 6.2% employee + 6.2% employer)
- Benefits based on average earnings and claiming age
- Indexed for inflation (Cost of Living Adjustments – COLA)
- Backed by U.S. government, not market returns

## 3. Primary Insurance Amount (PIA)

The PIA is the monthly benefit you receive at Full Retirement Age (FRA).

### 3.1 PIA Formula (2024 Bend Points):

```text
PIA = 90% of first $1,174 of AIME
    + 32% of AIME from $1,174 to $7,078
    + 15% of AIME over $7,078
```

Where:
- AIME = Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (based on top 35 years, wage-indexed)

## 4. Claiming Age Impacts

| Age | Benefit Adjustment |
|------|--------------------|
| 62   | ~70-75% of PIA     |
| 67   | 100% of PIA (FRA)  |
| 70   | ~124-132% of PIA   |

- Claiming early results in a **permanent reduction**
- Delaying after FRA increases benefit by **8% per year**
- Benefits are **actuarially neutral** but may not be optimal for longevity risk

---

## 5. Spousal and Survivor Benefits

### 5.1 Spousal Benefit

- Up to 50% of spouse’s PIA
- Only if spouse has filed
- Reductions apply if claimed before FRA

### 5.2 Survivor Benefit

- Up to 100% of deceased spouse’s benefit
- Can be claimed as early as age 60
- Switch between survivor and personal benefit is allowed

---

## 6. Taxation of Social Security

Depending on income, up to 85% of benefits may be taxable:

- **Provisional Income** = AGI + tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS benefits
- Thresholds:
  - $25,000 (single) / $32,000 (joint): up to 50% taxable
  - $34,000 (single) / $44,000 (joint): up to 85% taxable

---

## 7. Claiming Strategies

### 7.1 Delay-and-Bridge

- Delay SS to age 70 for higher payout
- Withdraw from 401(k)/IRA early (lower tax bracket)
- Reduce future RMDs by shrinking pre-tax accounts

### 7.2 File-and-Suspend (No longer available)

### 7.3 Restricted Application (Only available if born before Jan 2, 1954)

- Can file for spousal only while own benefit accrues
- No longer permitted for younger cohorts

---

## 8. Coordination Strategies

- **Spousal Coordination**: Delay higher earner’s benefit
- **Survivor Planning**: Higher benefit stays with survivor
- **Health & Longevity**: Delay if good health/family longevity
- **Cash Flow Needs**: Early claiming may be necessary if no other income

---

## 9. Summary Table

| Strategy | Who Benefits | Key Trade-Off |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Early Claiming (62–66) | Shorter life expectancy, cash flow need | Lower lifetime benefit |
| Full Retirement (67) | Default choice | Balanced outcome |
| Delayed Claiming (68–70) | Healthy, higher earners, survivor benefit | Higher monthly income, lower RMD impact |

---

## 10. Conclusion

Social Security decisions are complex but powerful. Strategic claiming—especially when coordinated between spouses—can unlock tens of thousands in lifetime value and hedge against longevity risk.
